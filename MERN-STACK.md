2. NodeJS: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
3. ExpressJS: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.
