## Features Of Visual Studio
1. IDE: Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. 
2. Code Editor: Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer.
3. Debugger: Visual Studio includes a debugger that works both as a source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger. It works with both managed code as well as native code and can be used for debugging applications written in any language supported by Visual Studio.
4. Extesibility: Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to extend its capabilities. These extensions "plug into" Visual Studio and extend its functionality. Extensions come in the form of macros, add-ins, and packages. Macros represent repeatable tasks and actions that developers can record programmatically for saving, replaying, and distributing. Macros, however, cannot implement new commands or create tool windows.
5. Collaboration: Using this feature of Visual Studio, we can perform following task:
   1. Live editing. Author and edit code together in real time.
   2. Focus and Follow. Bring attention to your cursor or follow along as others navigate.
   3. Audio calls. Communicate with others over voice from within your tool.

## Plugins of Visual Studio
1. Settings Sync: Synchronize settings, snippets, themes, file icons, launch, keybindings, workspaces, and extensions across multiple machines using GitHub gists.
2. Import Cost: This extension will display inline in the editor the size of the imported package. The extension utilizes webpack with Babili Webpack Plugin in order to detect the imported size.
3. File Utils: A convenient way of creating, duplicating, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories.
4. npm Intellisense: VS Code plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements.
5. Project Manager: Project Manager helps you to easily access your projects, no matter where they’re located.Don’t miss important projects anymore. You can define your own projects (also called favorites) or choose autodetect Git, Mercurial or SVN repositories, or VS Code folders (or any other folder).
6. Git History: View your Git log and file history. You’re also able to compare branches or commits.
7. Code Spell Checker: The goal of this spell checker is to help catch common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low.
8. Remote - SSH: Open any folder on a remote machine using SSH, and take advantage of VS Code’s full feature set.The Remote - SSH extension lets you use any remote machine with an SSH server as your development environment. This can greatly simplify development and troubleshooting in a wide variety of situations.
